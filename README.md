## Assignment 2

Times from different inputs:

- input1.txt: __0.220s__
- input2.txt: __0.469s__
- input3.txt: __26.625s__
- input4.txt: __58m 39.667s__
- input5.txt: __idk, but i expect that one day__


For the input5.txt, what I will do is change the data structure, in somewhat that allows me to work with indexes, and then, insert the 1M elements using a dicotomic search, to locate their position.
